# Geocities Mode

A love letter to the chaotic beauty of late-90s web design. Every page load is different. Nothing is predictable. Everything is beautiful (in its own way).

## Visual Chaos

Random colors, backgrounds, and borders on everything. Gradients clash. Patterns tile. Text gets rainbow treatment. Some elements rotate slightly. Others skew. Z-index becomes a suggestion.

Fonts cycle through the classics: Comic Sans, Papyrus, Impact, Jokerman, and friends. Content areas stick to readable fonts. Everything else is fair game.

## Text Effects

- **Marquees**: Text scrolls in all directions
- **Rainbow headings**: Each letter a different hue
- **Blinking, pulsing, shaking**: The holy trinity
- **Wavy underlines, dotted overlines**: Because why not

## Mouse Magic

Your cursor changes constantly. Sometimes it's a crosshair. Sometimes it's "wait". Sometimes it leaves a trail of raccoons or stars behind it.

Lens flares follow your mouse. Some elements flee when you approach. Others explode into emoji when clicked.

## Particle Playground

Clickable particles everywhere:
- **Falling particles**: Snowflakes, leaves, hearts, or raccoons drifting down
- **Sparkle trails**: Glitter follows your cursor
- **Twinkling stars**: Fixed points of light across the page

Click them to earn points. Chain clicks for combo multipliers. Raccoons are worth 25 points. Your score persists across pages.

## Canvas Animations

- **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** banners with animated stripes
- Spinning wireframe shapes (cubes, pyramids, stars, spirals)
- ASCII art animations (dancing figures, loading bars, cats, raccoons)
- Demoscene-style fire effects
- Matrix rain with katakana and raccoons

## Status Bars

Nostalgic scrolling messages appear at the edges:
- "You are visitor #847293"
- "Best viewed in Netscape Navigator 4.0"
- "ICQ#: 48372910"
- "Now playing: canyon.mid"
- "Member of the Raccoon WebRing"

## Page Animations

Elements fly in from offscreen when the page loads. Some spin. Some scale. Some skew. Chaos mode means every element picks its own entrance.

Throughout the page, random elements get assigned looping animations: bounce, wobble, float, rubber band, jello.

## Sound Effects

Audio feedback for your clicks:
- Pop sounds for basic particles
- Whoosh for falling particles
- Twinkle for stars
- Ascending arpeggio for combo chains
- Triumphant jingle for catching raccoons

## Music

Procedurally generated endless music that reacts to the page. Nine genres, five radio stations, DJ announcements, and full player controls.

See [music/README.md](./music/README.md) for details.
