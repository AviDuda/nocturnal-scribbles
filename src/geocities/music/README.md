## What Is This

A never-ending stream of procedural music that plays in the corner of your screen. No two songs are the same. The music knows what page you're on, what time it is, and how chaotic your life choices are.

Reading a late-night blog post full of code blocks? Chill digital vibes.

3 AM on a Saturday with raccoon emojis everywhere? You're getting lofi trash panda beats.

Site covered in marquees, spinning GIFs, and fire emojis? Prepare for maximum energy happycore.

## Two Ways To Listen

### Tape Mode 📼

Your page becomes a mixtape. The music reacts to what you're viewing. Flip the tape for Side B and the whole mood inverts. Chill becomes chaos. Dark becomes bright.

### Radio Mode 📻

Tune into 20 stations on the information superhighway. Each has DJs, jingles, and commercials for fictional 90s web products like GuestBook Plus, MIDI Collection Pro, and the Forbidden Cat Adoption Agency.

Some stations:

- **RACCOON FM** (97.3) - Nocturnal beats for night owls
- **DUMPSTER DIVE FM** (3.AM) - We eat everything
- **RAVE.NET** (140.0) - Maximum BPM, minimum sleep
- **THE VOID** (0.01) - ...
- **MIDNIGHT.GOV** (0.00) - Numbers. Only numbers.
- **CAFE.FM** (45.0) - Take your time
- **PIRATE RADIO** (???) - Unauthorized broadcast
- **HOLD MUSIC** (1.800) - Your call is important to us

## The Forbidden Cats Are Here

This player was clearly made by raccoons. The DJ voices read guestbook entries from TrashPandaFan and xX_DarkAngel_Xx. The commercials sell Dumpster Diving Certification Courses. Track names like `3am_raccoon_lofi_F#` appear without explanation.

If you see a raccoon emoji on the page, the music knows. It always knows.

## Genres

Nine flavors of late-90s internet music:

- **Chiptune** - 8-bit arcade bleeps
- **MIDI** - The authentic sound of someone's Angelfire homepage
- **Synthwave** - Neon nights, chrome highways, 1985 forever
- **Lofi** - Jazzy beats to study/procrastinate to
- **Vaporwave** - Empty malls, marble fountains, slowed-down memories
- **Ambient** - Drifting through the void
- **Techno** - Machine precision, warehouse energy
- **Trance** - Euphoric builds, hands in the air
- **Happycore** - 180 BPM, no regrets

The player picks genres based on the mood of your page. Dark page at 3 AM? Probably vaporwave or ambient. Bright page with sparkle emojis? Chiptune or happycore.

## Old Posts Sound Dusty

Reading something from a year ago? The music gets that worn-cassette treatment. Tape hiss. Vinyl crackle. The older the post, the dustier the sound. Archives should sound like archives.

## Automix

When one song ends, another begins. With automix on, they blend together like a DJ set. The tempo stays close, the vibes stay right, and you never have to touch a thing.

## Chaos Slider

There's a slider labeled CHAOS. Turn it up and everything gets weirder. More detuning. More wobble. More unpredictable genre shifts. Turn it down for a calmer, more focused sound. But where's the fun in that?

## Export

Download your procedural creation as WAV or MIDI. The WAV takes about 45 minutes to download on a 56k modem. Worth it.

## Why

This isn't meant to sound professional. It's meant to sound like the background music in a Flash game, or the MIDI auto-playing on someone's 1998 homepage, or the soundtrack to browsing GeoCities at 2 AM when you should be sleeping.

Every refresh brings a new track. Every page sounds different.
